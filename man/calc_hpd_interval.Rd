\title{Calculate the Highest Probability Density of an MCMC trace that
  has its burn-in removed}
\usage{
calc_hpd_interval(trace, proportion = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{trace}{a numeric vector of parameter estimates obtained from
an MCMC run. Must have its burn-in removed}

\item{proportion}{the proportion of numbers within the interval.
For example, use 0.95 for a 95 percentage interval}
}
\value{
a numeric vector, with at index 1 the lower boundary of the
  interval, and at index 2 the upper boundary of the interval
}
